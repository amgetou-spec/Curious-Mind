<p>Eritrean Name</p>


     <p>
The name Eritrea origina
  tes from the ancient Greek term "Erythraia" (Ἐρυθραία), meaning "red" (erythros), referring to the Red Sea. This was then adopted into the Latin form "Mare Erythraeum". The Italians, during their 19th-century colonization, named the colony Eritrea, taking the name from the surrounding body of water.
